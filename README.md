# Biohazard Escape

Biohazard Escape is a console-based grid survival game written in **C++**.

The player navigates a fog-covered laboratory, avoiding spreading enemies, collecting energy boosts, and reaching the exit before running out of energy. Each move consumes energy, while enemies dynamically spread across the map, increasing tension with every turn.

## Features
- Grid-based map with fog-of-war visibility
- Turn-based player movement
- Randomly generated walls, enemies, and energy boosts
- Enemy spread mechanic that escalates difficulty
- Energy-based survival system
- Win and loss conditions

---

## Controls
- `1` — Move Up  
- `2` — Move Down  
- `3` — Move Left  
- `4` — Move Right

## How to Run

## Visual Studio (Windows)
1. Create a new **C++ Console Application**
2. Replace the generated `main.cpp` with `src/main.cpp`
3. Build and run the project

---

## Technologies Used
- C++
- Standard Library (`iostream`, `vector`, `cstdlib`, `ctime`)

---

## What I Learned
- Managing game state in a turn-based system
- Implementing fog-of-war mechanics
- Designing enemy spread and survival logic
- Structuring a small C++ project cleanly
- Handling input and output for interactive console applications
